    "\n",
    "Category-based Analysis: Utilize a pivot table to analyze the cumulative sum of prices for different product categories in various shopping malls, providing insights into the contribution of each category to total sales.\n",
    "Dynamic Visualization: Generate a bar chart race using the 'bcr' library to visually represent the changing dominance of product categories in terms of cumulative prices over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Briefs on the Data & the Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Transformation: The original DataFrame is transformed into a pivot table, with 'shopping_mall' as the index, 'category' as columns, and the sum of 'price' as values. This helps aggregate the total sales amount for each category in each shopping mall.\n",
    "Cumulative Summation: The resulting pivot table is cumulatively summed along the columns, representing the total cumulative prices for each product category in each shopping mall.\n",
    "Bar Chart Race: The 'bcr' library is then used to create a bar chart race, illustrating the dynamic changes in cumulative prices for different product categories across shopping malls over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Observations\n",
    "\n",
    "Category Dominance: The bar chart race dynamically demonstrates the dominance of specific product categories in terms of cumulative prices. Patterns such as fluctuations or sustained growth in certain categories become evident as clothing remains the most sold category followed by shoes and technology. while the Souvenir are sold least in each of the malls.\n",
    "Shopping Mall Comparison: By visually tracking the changes, it becomes apparent how different shopping malls may vary in their emphasis on particular product categories, providing insights into consumer preferences across locations books are sold more than food and beaverages in Cevahir AVM, Emaar Square Mall, Forum Istanbul malls only.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Managerial Implications or Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "Product Category Strategy: Mall managers can use insights from the analysis to strategize the placement and promotion of clothing categories, focusing resources on high-performing categories like clothing, shoes and technology .\n",
    "Marketing and Merchandising: Tailoring marketing efforts and merchandising strategies based on the popularity of specific categories can enhance the overall shopping experience and boost sales.\n",
    "Revenue Optimization: Understanding the cumulative prices of different categories allows for strategic decisions on inventory management and pricing strategies, ultimately optimizing overall revenue by keeping stock of high selling category and keeping lesser stock of low selling categories such as toys,books,souvenirs etc."
